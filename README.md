# Numerical Simulations for Learning Convolution Operators 

This repository contains the numerical simulations accompanying our paper, which addresses the problem of learning convolution operators (on) with compact Abelian groups). The simulations illustrate our theoretical findings through a series of practical examples, helping to clarify and validate the accuracy of the estimators in various settings.


## Structure of the Repository

- **`src/`**: Contains the main code for setting up and running the simulations.
- **`data/`**: Contains any data generated or used in the simulations.
- **`notebooks/`**: Jupyter notebooks to reproduce and visualize the results of the simulations.
- **experiment.py**: The main scripts to run the simulations.
- **`results/`**: Outputs from the simulations, including plots and saved model parameters.
