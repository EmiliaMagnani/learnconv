    """
    Generates a specified number of samples drawn from a power-law probability distribution

    Parameters:
    ----------
    n_samples : int
        The number of samples to generate.
    max_value : int
        The maximum value in the range from which samples are drawn (inclusive).
    exponent : float
        The exponent of the power-law distribution. Higher values lead to more 
        weight on smaller numbers.
    rng : numpy.random.Generator
        Random number generator instance (from `np.random.default_rng()`).

    Returns:
    -------

        An array of `n_samples` integers drawn from the power-law distribution.

def power_law_samples_symmetric_including_dc(n_samples, max_value, exponent, rng, dc_weight=.5):
    """
    Generate samples from a symmetric power-law distribution over candidate frequencies,
    including the DC (zero-frequency) component.
    
    The candidate frequencies are constructed as:
        [0, -max_value, -max_value+1, ..., -1, 1, ..., max_value]
    For each candidate frequency x, a weight is assigned as follows:
        - For x == 0 (the DC component), the weight is set to dc_weight.
        - For x != 0, the weight is computed as 1 / |x|**exponent.
    
    These weights are normalized to form a probability distribution over the candidate set.
    Then, n_samples frequencies are drawn randomly according to this probability distribution.
    
    Parameters
    ----------
    n_samples : int
        The number of frequency samples to generate.
    max_value : int
        The maximum absolute frequency value. The candidate set consists of integers from -max_value
        to max_value, with 0 added separately.
    exponent : float
        The exponent in the power-law decay. Larger values yield lower probabilities for higher frequencies.
    rng : numpy.random.Generator
        A random number generator instance (e.g., created with np.random.default_rng(seed)).
        This is used to ensure reproducible sampling.
    dc_weight : float, optional
        The weight assigned to the zero frequency (DC component). Default is 0.5.
    
    Returns
    -------
    samples : numpy.ndarray
        A one-dimensional array of length n_samples containing the sampled frequencies.
